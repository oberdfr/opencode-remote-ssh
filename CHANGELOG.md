# Changelog

All notable changes to opencode-remote-ssh will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

## [1.2.0] - 2026-10-08

### Added

- Ported the plugin to the native OpenCode V2 Plugin API (`@opencode/plugin`) with `Plugin.define` and lifecycle registrations.
- Added `remote-shell` (`remote_shell`) tool to execute shell commands directly on the active remote host and workspace with permission handling.
- Registered both hyphenated (`remote-switch`) and underscore (`remote_switch`) tool aliases for compatibility across all client environments.
- Added automated V2 plugin definition and tool registration unit tests (`plugin/src/v2.test.ts`).

### Changed

- Updated `opencode-remote-cli.sh` to support OpenCode V2 configuration (`plugins: [...]`) and JSONC files with comments.
- Updated `verify-remote-lifecycle.mjs` to parse JSONC configurations and resolve V2 plugin configuration entries.
- Enhanced `config.ts` stub binary path discovery to automatically detect pre-built stub binaries.
- Preserved OpenCode V1 entrypoint backwards compatibility.


### Added

- Added optional host `aliases` in provider configuration so a workspace target can resolve a host by either its canonical `name` or any configured alias.
- Added user-facing `remote-switch`, `remote-status`, `remote-disconnect`, and `remote-doctor` tools for first-launch connection, recovery, preflight validation, and cleanup.
- Added lower-level `remote-workspace-create`, `remote-workspace-list`, and `remote-workspace-remove` tools for direct workspace management.
- Added a live remote lifecycle harness, available with `npm run verify:remote -- --provider <provider> --host <host>` from `plugin/`, that exercises provider resolution, SSH bootstrap, tunneling, health checks, workspace/session creation, permission approval, shell execution, and cleanup against a configured host.

### Changed

- Clarified the README, architecture notes, and test plan to document alias-based host resolution and the current detached remote stub startup behavior.
- Documented the recommended first-launch flow and live verification harness.
- Changed remote stub install behavior to compare local and remote hashes before upload, so a matching installed binary is reused instead of overwritten.

### Fixed

- Improved `setup-host.sh` remote stub startup by launching the stub in its own session and waiting slightly longer before validation, which reduces bootstrap failures on older Linux hosts where child processes can die when the SSH parent exits.
- Fixed SSH bootstrap so stub updates upload to a remote temporary path and install with a remote move, avoiding direct overwrite failures on hosts that reject SFTP-backed writes to the live binary path.
- Fixed recovered tunnel bindings so fallback local ports are persisted and health-checked instead of retrying the stale preferred port.
- Fixed lease reuse so an existing workspace can re-resolve its own host lease by canonical name, `ssh.host`, or alias.
- Fixed stale recovered bindings so unresolved or unreachable persisted state is removed instead of blocking future connections.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-05-06

### Changed

- Standardized the public setup flow around package-based plugin registration.
- Simplified the plugin to focus on the generic provider-based workspace lifecycle.
- Updated the setup and CLI documentation to match the current supported behavior.

### Fixed

- Removed shipped hard-coded hostnames, usernames, SSH key paths, and developer-local home directory assumptions from the plugin runtime.
- Removed implicit permission auto-approval so remote path access now follows the documented explicit approval flow.
- Fixed SSH bootstrap to resolve remote home directories dynamically and verify remote health before marking workspaces ready.
- Reworked remote stub startup to support older Linux hosts by using a statically built stub and a detached Python-based startup fallback when plain `nohup` is unreliable.
- Fixed `setup-host.sh` output so it now provides exact manual recovery steps when password-assisted bootstrap cannot complete automatically.
- Fixed `opencode-remote-cli.sh` so it clearly supports package-based plugin config only, safely refuses path-based mutation, and supports host aliases where `name` differs from `ssh.host`.

### Added

- Added documented operating guidance for password-only hosts, including both `sshpass` and manual authorized-keys bootstrap paths.
- Added documented host alias usage, including mapping friendly names to real SSH hosts through configuration.
- Added a tested path for bootstrapping and connecting to older CentOS/RHEL 7 era hosts.

## [1.0.0] - 2025-05-05

### Added

- **Provider-Based Host Management**: Define collections of remote hosts organized by providers with label-based selection
- **SSH Bootstrap**: Automatically uploads and installs the Go stub to remote hosts via SCP/SSH
- **Local SSH Tunnel**: Creates SSH port forwarding so the remote appears as a local endpoint
- **Permission-First Security**: Path access is denied by default; approvals are requested through OpenCode's normal permission flow
- **Persistent Approvals**: `always` approvals persist across stub restarts for the same workspace
- **CLI Tool**: `opencode-remote-cli.sh` for easy host management and setup
- **Workspace Adaptor Registration**: Plugin registers "ssh-provider" workspace type with OpenCode
- **Idempotent Setup**: Prevents duplicate entries when running setup multiple times
- **Automatic Key Generation**: Creates dedicated SSH key per host during setup if no key exists
- **Timestamped Backups**: Config backups are automatically created with timestamps

### Components

- **Plugin** (`plugin/`): TypeScript workspace adaptor for OpenCode
- **Stub** (`stub/`): Go HTTP service installed on remote hosts
- **Setup Scripts**:
  - `setup-host.sh`: SSH-based remote setup automation
  - `opencode-remote-cli.sh`: CLI for managing hosts in OpenCode config
  - `run-local-stub.sh`: Local stub testing helper

### Configuration

- Plugin configuration via `opencode.json` under `plugin` key
- Support for multiple providers with multiple hosts each
- SSH authentication via identity file or password
- Configurable tunnel ports, timeouts, and selection strategies

### API Endpoints (Stub)

The remote stub implements OpenCode-compatible endpoints:

- `GET /global/health` - Health/version check
- `GET /global/event` - SSE event stream
- `GET/POST /experimental/workspace*` - Workspace lifecycle
- `POST/GET/DELETE /session*` - Session lifecycle
- `POST /session/{id}/shell` - Execute shell command
- `POST /session/{id}/command` - Execute structured command
- `GET/POST /permission*` - Permission requests

### Security

- Stub binds only to `127.0.0.1` (localhost only)
- All requests require bearer token authentication
- Path access denied by default
- Symlink escape attempts blocked
- Commands constrained to approved directories

### Known Limitations

- Linux-only remote hosts in v1
- Exclusive host leases (one workspace per host at a time)
- No automatic stub restart detection in plugin

## [0.0.1] - 2025-04-01

### Added

- Initial prototype with basic SSH tunnel and stub
- Workspace adaptor scaffolding
- Basic permission system
